This website was originally built in Symfony1 which is extremely outdated. 
Rebuilding the site in a modern Symfony framework would have been the recommended move, but the funds were not available. 

Instead I directly updated the Symfony1 engine code to run properly in PHP8, replacing all deprecated functions with modern alternatives.
This allowed the site to continue existing in servers that no longer support older PHP version. 
Probably opened security issues, but it was good fun, and didn't cost the client much.

I did recommend a more reasonable approach. The client has since gone out of business for unrelated reasons.
