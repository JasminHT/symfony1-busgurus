Core Plugins

The following core plugins have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 and will be removed in symfony 1.4:

    sfCompat10Plugin: By deprecating this plugin, we also deprecate all other elements in the framework that rely on this plugin to work (1.0 admin generator, and 1.0 form system). It also includes the default admin generator theme for 1.0 located in lib/plugins/sfPropelPlugin/data/generator/sfPropelAdmin.

    sfProtoculousPlugin: The helpers provided by this plugin do not support unobstrusiveness, and as such should not be used anymore.
